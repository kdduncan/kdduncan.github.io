<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Young-Economist-William-Thomson/dp/026251589X/">So you want to be an Economist?</a></h3>

<p>William Thomson's "A Guide for the Young Economist" provides an illustrative guide to both undergraduate's looking to enter grad school, as well as graduate students who find themselves unsure of what the path forward looks like for them. Sadly, I found myself in the later group, but I suggest it for anyone who is looking for a relatively cheap look at what expectations are giong forward. For some, it might disuade them from an Economics PhD, and for others illuminate new paths to improve their graduate experience.</p>

Below is a list of textbooks that I consider core to my graduate education and current reference material. I have generally tried to list them in order of approachability, or the order in which an inexperienced student might try to tackle the texts.
</p>

<h3>Mathematical Texts</h3>
<p>Simon and Blume, "Mathematics for Economists."</p>
<p>Rudin, Walter, "Principles of Mathematical Analysis."</p>
<p>Bass, Richard F, "Real Analysis for Graduate Students."</p>


<h3>Microeconomic Theory</h3>
<p>Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green, "Microeconomic Theory"</p>
<p>Jehle and Reny, "Advanced Microeconomic Theory"</p>
<p>Kreps, "Microeconomic Foundations I"</p>
<p>Fudenberg and Tirole, "Game Theory"</p>

<p>None of the first three texts covers game theory particularly well, for which there is no good substitute on graduate level game theory than Fudenberg and Tirole's "Game Theory" text.</p>

<h3>Macroeconomic Theory</h3>
<p>Stokey and Lucas, "Recursive Methods in Economic Dynamics"</p>
<p>Ljungqvist, Sargent, "Recursive acroeconomic Theory"</p>

<h3>Econometrics</h3>
<p>Casella and Berger, "Statistical Inference"</p>
<p>Hayashi, "Econometrics"</p>
<p>Hamilton, "Time Series Analysis"</p>
<p>Wooldridge, "Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data"</p>
