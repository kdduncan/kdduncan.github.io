  <h2>About </h2>
  <p>I was born in Washington, DC, but spent most of my youth growing up in Andover, Massachusetts. I began my undergraduate studies at Moravian College in Bethlehem, PA working towards a  Political Science degree before transferring to the George Washington University in Washington, DC going into my junior year, where I eventually graduated with a a BSc in the summer of 2011 with a double major in Economics and Political Science. After taking a year off interning at think tanks in DC, I began in Iowa State University's Economics Masters program in the fall of 2012 and upgraded into the PhD program in fall 2013.</p>

  <p>I plan on completing the MSc in Economics by the end of summer 2015 while concurrently pursuing the PhD. My Masters' research deals with the impacts of tax and regulatory policies impact on firm entry. I have just completed my second year in the PhD program focusing on labor, industrial organization, and applied econometrics. However, I plan on specializing in econometric theory for dissertation research. I am active in the community and department through an adult ice hockey league, running a graduate student seminar series, and routinely hosting barbecues and gatherings for fellow graduate students.</p>

  <p>Starting in Fall of 2015 I will be the recipient of the Wayne W. Gross Graduate Fellowship. <a href="https://www.las.iastate.edu/anonymous-alumni-gift-for-economics-honors-fallen-vietnam-war-soldier/">For information on the Fellowship and Wayne W. Gross's service and sacrifice to the US</a>. <a href="WayneWGrossGraduateFellowshipLetter.pdf">My letter to the donor</a>.</p>
