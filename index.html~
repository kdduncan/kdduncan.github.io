<h1>Kevin Duncan's Webpage</h1>
<h2>About </h2>
<p>My name is Kevin Duncan, a second year PhD Candidate in Economics at Iowa State University. <br> My research for the past two years with Peter Orazem and Georgeanne Artz has involved looking at the impacts of state policies on relative economic growth using differences between counties on state borders.
</p>

<p> My research interests are in labor and public economics, as well as in theoretical econometrics. I am also an avid dog owner, biker, and weekend griller.</p>
