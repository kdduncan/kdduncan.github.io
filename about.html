  <h2>About </h2>
  <p>I was born in Washington, DC, but spent most of my youth growing up in Andover, Massachusetts. I began my undergraduate studies at Moravian College in Bethlehem, PA working towards a  Political Science degree before transferring to the George Washington University in Washington, DC going into my junior year, where I eventually graduated with a a BSc in the summer of 2011 with a double major in Economics and Political Science. After taking a year off interning at think tanks in DC, I began in Iowa State University's Economics Masters program in the fall of 2012 and upgraded into the PhD program in fall 2013.</p>

  <p>I recently completed a MSc in Economics. My Masters' research deals with the impacts of tax and regulatory policies impact on firm entry using regression discontinuity techniques. I have just completed my second year in the PhD program focusing on labor, industrial organization, and applied econometrics. However, I plan on specializing in econometric theory for my dissertation research. I am active in the community and department through an adult ice hockey league, running a graduate student seminar series, and routinely hosting barbecues and gatherings for fellow graduate students.</p>

  <p>Starting in Fall of 2015 I will be the recipient of the Wayne W. Gross Graduate Fellowship. <a href="https://www.las.iastate.edu/anonymous-alumni-gift-for-economics-honors-fallen-vietnam-war-soldier/">For information on the Fellowship and Wayne W. Gross's service and sacrifice to the US</a>. <a href="WayneWGrossGraduateFellowshipLetter.pdf">My letter to the donor</a>.</p>
