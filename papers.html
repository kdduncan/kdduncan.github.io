<h4>"The Capital Purchase Program's Effect on Firm Dynamics over the Business Cycle" [Job Market Paper]</h4>

<p>Following the 2008 Financial Crisis the Capital Purchase Program dispersed over \$200 billion dollars to banks hoping to prevent foreclosure and ease tightened lending conditions. Using census data on county level business dynamics this paper estimates the impacts of the Treasury Department's Capital Purchase Program on establishment entry, establishment exit, employment expansion, and employment contraction following the 2008 Financial Crisis. We estimate the direct effects of a county having a bank receive Capital Purchase Program funds on local business dynamics in the seven years following treatment, as well as spillover effects as entrepreneurs and business in neighboring regions travel to gain access to credit. Estimates show the CPP had no effect on establishment entry and exit, nor employment expansion and contraction. This paper establishes that the business-lending aims of the CPP were not realized in the communities and regions that received funds, and casts further doubt on meaningful pass through of CPP funds to desirable local economic activity. <b><a href="./papers/duncan_CPPEstabDynamics.pdf">Working Paper</a></b></p>

<h4> "Linear Hypothesis Tests for Fixed Effects with Serially Correlated Panels" </h4>

<p>I develop a joint hypothesis test over fixed effects in large $n$ small $T$ panel data models with symmetric serial correlation among individuals. This enables joint hypothesis tests over inconsistent fixed effects estimates, including the traditional varying intercept model as well as models with individual specific slope coefficients. I establish two different set of assumptions where a feasible tests exist. The first assumption requires that individual errors follow a stationary $\ARp$ process. Under this assumption all second and fourth cross product moments can be consistently estimated, while allowing for both individual specific hypothesis to be imposed on the data and covariates to vary across individuals and time with individual specific slopes. The second set of assumptions requires the presence of a known group structure of individuals such that there are at least two people in each group, and that the covariate values and coefficient slopes are shared among all individuals in that group. This set of assumptions enable estimation of a completely unconstrained variance-covariance matrix and higher cross product moments for individuals. <b><a href="./papers/duncan_HypothesisTestsOverFixedEffects.pdf">Preliminary Working Paper</a></b></p>

<h4>"Impacts of Taxes on Firm Entry Rates along State Borders" with Georgeanne M. Artz and Peter F. Orazem</h4>

<p>This paper uses a border discontinuity approach to estimate the impacts of taxes on firm entry rates between neighboring states. We utilize matched county pairs as an approximate bandwidth around the discontinuity in state policies imposed at their border. This controls for unobserved location specific determinants of firm entry, as well as policy responses to shocks shared across borders. We estimate the impacts of property, income, sales, corporate, capital gains, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax rates on the differences in firm entry between counties. Our array of taxes controls for joint changes in tax policy that governments may implement to accomplish policy goals. We estimate this impact using a sample of 107 state-border pairs between 1999 and 2009. Our results indicate that property and sales taxes have the largest negative effect on firm start up rates, and in more recent years, income taxes as well. <b><a href="./papers/Duncan_FirmEntry.pdf">Working Paper</a></b></p>

<h4>"Do Nudges Induce Safe Driving? Evidence from Dynamic Message Signs"</h4>

<p>Behavioral economics has transformed the way we think about policy problems of our age. Governments all over the world are using nudges, one of the tools from behavioral economics, to direct people’s behavior towards socially desirable outcomes. However, the literature has also shown that the distributive effects of nudges are not uniform, meaning that there are people who gain from a particular nudge, while others are made worse off. In this research, we are looking at the impact of traffic-related messages such as “drive sober,” “x deaths on roads this year,” and "click it or ticket,” on reported near-to-sign traffic accidents. While these signs aim to make drivers think of the dangers of unsafe driving and hence potentially lead to safe driver and a lower number of crashes and fatalities, it also causes welfare-reducing emotional/moral discomfort to the drivers. We develop a model of unsafe driving that highlights the potential channel by which nudges can affect driving outcomes along with imposing a disutility to the drivers. To estimate the causal effect of these nudges, we build a new panel dataset using the information on the time and location of messages, traffic incidents, overall traffic levels, and weather in the state of Vermont. We estimate several models that induce independence between signs by taking signs that are either 10 or 5 miles apart. We then build two Poisson fixed effects models with spillover effects that enable the estimation of near to sign treatment effects when upstream signs have non-zero impacts on driver behavior on downstream signs. The first allows for a sign to have its nearest upstream neighbor within 10 or 5 miles, as long as that neighbor has no upstream neighbor within 10 or 5 miles. The second tests whether or not any upstream sign within 10 or 5 miles had a nudging message during a given hour. These enable us to increase our sample and get more robust estimates for our treatment effects.  <b><a href="./papers/asadduncan_SafeDrivingNudges.pdf">Working Paper</a></b></p>

  <h4>"Do State Business Climate Indicators Explain Relative Economic Growth at State Borders?" with Georgeanne M. Artz, Kevin D. Duncan, Arthur P.  Hall, Peter F. Orazem; Forthcoming Journal of Regional Science</h4>

<p>This study submits eleven business climate indexes to tests of their ability to predict economic performance on either side of state borders. Our results show that most business climate indexes have no ability to predict relative economic growth regardless of how growth is measured. Some are negatively correlated with relative growth. Many are better at reporting past growth than at predicting the future. In the end, the most predictive business climate index is the Grant Thornton Index which was discontinued in 1989. <b><a href="./papers/bus-clim-journal-paper_final.pdf">Working Paper</a></b></p> <b><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jors.12261/abstract">Published Version</a></b>
