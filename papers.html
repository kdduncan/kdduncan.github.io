<h4>"The Troubled Asset Relief Program's Effect on Firm Entry over the Business Cycle" [Job Market Paper]</h4>

<p>This paper studies the impacts of banks receiving investment from the Treasury Departmentâ€™s Capital Purchase Program (CPP) on surrounding county business dynamics during the 2008 Financial Crisis. I hypothesize prospective firms had an easier time gaining loans in counties that received CPP funds relative to similar counties that did not, resulting in higher firm entry in treated counties. I estimate the average treatment for the treated of a county receiving CPP funds on the log number of new establishments in the 4 years following CPP injections. My estimation strategy combines several techniques to extend established matching estimators. Due to the spatial structure of our data we combine dynamic matching techniques ([Lechner, 2008]) while relaxing the traditional Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) to account for interference effects ([Freyrer et al., 2017]). I further utilize this structure to discuss synthetic control estimators ([Abadie et al., 2010]) without the SUTVA assumption.
This structure enables estimation of both the main effect of a county receiving treatment, as well as spillover effect of neighbors. Preliminary results find no discernible difference in county business dynamics over this time horizon between treated an comparable untreated counties.  <b><a href="./papers/duncan_tarpfirmentry_prelim.pdf">Preliminary Working Paper</a></b></p>

<h4> "Linear Hypothesis Tests for Fixed Effects with Serially Correlated Panels" </h4>

<p>I develop a joint test over fixed effects in large $n$ small $T$ panel data models with symmetric serial correlation among individuals. This enables joint hypothesis tests over inconsistent fixed effects estimates, including the traditional varying intercept model as well as models with individual specific slope coefficients. I establish two different set of assumptions where a feasible tests exist. The first assumption requires that individual errors follow a stationary AR(p) process. Under this assumption all second and fourth cross product moments can be consistently estimated, while allowing for both a completely unconstrained joint hypothesis to be imposed on the data and covariates to vary across individuals and time with individual specific slopes. The second set of assumptions requires the presence of a known group structure of individuals such that there are at least two people in each group, and that the covariate values are shared among all individuals in that group. This set of assumptions enable estimation of a completely unconstrained variance-covariance matrix and higher cross product moments for individuals. <b><a href="./papers/duncan_fixedeffectshypothesistests_prelim.pdf">Preliminary Working Paper</a></b></p> 

<h4>"Impacts of Taxes on Firm Entry Rates along State Borders" with Georgeanne M. Artz and Peter F. Orazem</h4>

<p>This paper uses a border discontinuity approach to estimate the impacts of taxes on firm entry rates between neighboring states. We utilize matched county pairs as an approximate bandwidth around the discontinuity in state policies imposed at their border. This controls for unobserved location specific determinants of firm entry, as well as policy responses to shocks shared across borders. We estimate the impacts of property, income, sales, corporate, capital gains, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax rates on the differences in firm entry between counties. Our array of taxes controls for joint changes in tax policy that governments may implement to accomplish policy goals. We estimate this impact using a sample of 107 state-border pairs between 1999 and 2009. Our results indicate that property and sales taxes have the largest negative effect on firm start up rates, and in more recent years, income taxes as well. <b><a href="./papers/Duncan_FirmEntry.pdf">Working Paper Version</a></b></p>

  <h4>"Do State Business Climate Indicators Explain Relative Economic Growth at State Borders?" with Georgeanne M. Artz, Kevin D. Duncan, Arthur P.  Hall, Peter F. Orazem; Forthcoming Journal of Regional Science</h4>

<p>This study submits eleven business climate indexes to tests of their ability to predict economic performance on either side of state borders. Our results show that most business climate indexes have no ability to predict relative economic growth regardless of how growth is measured. Some are negatively correlated with relative growth. Many are better at reporting past growth than at predicting the future. In the end, the most predictive business climate index is the Grant Thornton Index which was discontinued in 1989. <b><a href="./papers/bus-clim-journal-paper_final.pdf">Working Paper Version</a></b></p> <b><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jors.12261/abstract">Published Version</a></b>
