Somehow <a href="https://chroniclevitae.com/news/1026-there-s-no-crying-in-graduate-school">this</a> article about emotions in grad school came across my feed, and I resounded with it pretty strongly. As a result, I have catalogued some of my own experiences with graduate school that fellow students, or future students, might draw reference from.

Since coming to grad school I've experienced several emotional breakdowns. Just this last spring semester, spring 2015, I hurridly rushed to school and broke down in my advisors doorway asking him to help me finish grading that I thought incorrectly was due that afternoon, rather than the following day's as I had originally thought. Last Fall, during an oral final exam, a professor conceeded, "it seems like graduate school is nothing but non-positive reinforcement." Students, whether as physical students in the class room, RA's, or co-authors, are rarely given proper signals when they are doing something right, but are certainly given strong signals when they are doing something even minorly wrong.

Alone, grad school is terrifying for the stress imposed by qualifying exams, and the time one invests to try and complete a degree (particularly doctorates). Sitting through qualifying exams is prone to give even the most confident students night terrors, especially if they are forced to take the dreaded "second attempt" after with failure is a forced removal from the program, even after several years of pre-dissertation study. 

Over time a variety of things have helped me alleviate the anxiety brought on by graduate school. First, is a robust network of relationships both inside and outside of the department. Having people to catartically vent to helps, as well as having a group of people to go do stuff that is almost entirely removed from my day to day trials and tribulations. Secondly, has been professors who have encouraged me to treat them like individuals as well. This has included simply pushing me to call them by their first name, and secondly sharing with me some of their own anxieties and issues with getting papers published, harsh comments from their reviewers, etc, and to release graduate school is full of people who are at their core, decidedly human.
