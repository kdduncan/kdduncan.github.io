  <h4>"Do State Business Climate Indicators Explain Relative Economic Growth at State Borders?" with Georgeanne Artz, Kevin D. Duncan, Arthur Hall, Peter F. Orazem; Forthcoming Journal of Regional Science</h3>

<p>This study submits eleven business climate indexes to tests of their ability to predict economic performance on either side of state borders. Our results show that most business climate indexes have no ability to predict relative economic growth regardless of how growth is measured. Some are negatively correlated with relative growth. Many are better at reporting past growth than at predicting the future. In the end, the most predictive business climate index is the Grant Thornton Index which was discontinued in 1989. <b><a href="./papers/bus-clim-journal-paper_final.pdf">Working Paper Version</a></b></p>

<h4>"Impacts of Taxes on Firm Entry Rates along State Borders"with Georgeanne Artz, Kevin D. Duncan, Peter F. Orazem</h3>

<p>This paper uses a regression discontinuity approach to estimate the impacts of taxes on firm entry rates between neighboring states. We utilize matched county pairs as an approximate bandwidth around the discontinuity in state policies imposed at their border. This controls for unobserved location specific determinants of firm entry, as well as policy responses to shocks shared across borders. We then estimate the impacts of property, income, sales, corporate, capital gains, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax rates on the differences in firm entry between counties. Our array of taxes controls for joint changes in tax policy that governments may implement to accomplish policy goals. We estimate this impact using a sample of 107 state-border pairs between 1999 and 2009. Our results indicate that property and sales taxes have the largest negative effect on firm start up rates, and in more recent year's income taxes as well. <b><a href="./papers/Duncan_FirmEntry.pdf">Working Paper Version</a></b></p>
