My research deals with estimating the economic impacts of government policies on regional economic conditions, which a primary focus on firm entry. Understanding the impacts of different government policies on firm entry can provide lasting employment and productivity growth to local communities. Trying to empirically estimate these effects has also helped me develop new methods to explore underlying heterogeneity, and to control for spatial dependence in matching estimation.

On the applied side, my research includes showing most business climate indices do not have any predictive power on future economic growth, followed by research on the impacts of state level tax discrepencies and the Federal Capital Purchase Program on firm entry. In turn, my econometric theory work has developed novel methods of inference for underlying heterogeneity even in the presence of large, inconsistent, estimators. More recently I have started to work on applications of matching estimators to spatially dependent data.
