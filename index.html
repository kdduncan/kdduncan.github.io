<h2>About </h2>
<hr>
<p>I was born in Washington, DC, but spent most of my youth growing up in Andover, Massachusetts. I began my undergraduate studies at Moravian College in Bethlehem, PA working towards a  Political Science degree before transferring to the George Washington University in Washington DC going into my junior year, where I eventually graduated with a a B.S. in August 2011 with a double major in Economics and Political Science. After taking a year off interning at think tanks in DC, I began in Iowa State University's Economics Masters program in the fall of 2012 and upgraded into the Ph.D. program in fall 2013.</p>

<p>I am concurrently completing the M.S. in Economics while pursuing the Ph.D. despite it not being part of the required doctorate program of study. I have just completed my second year in the Ph.D. program focusing on labor, industrial organization, and applied econometrics. My current research deals with the impacts of tax and regulatory policies impact on economic growth. However, I plan on focusing on econometrics for dissertation research. I am active in the community and department through an adult ice hockey league, running a graduate student seminar series, and routinely hosting barbecues and gatherings for fellow graduate students.</p>

<p>Starting in Fall of 2015 I will be the recipient of the Wayne W. Gross Graduate Fellowship. <a href="https://www.las.iastate.edu/anonymous-alumni-gift-for-economics-honors-fallen-vietnam-war-soldier/">For information on the Fellowship and Wayne W. Gross's service and sacrifice to the US</a>. <a href="WayneWGrossGraduateFellowshipLetter.pdf">My letter to the donor</a>.</p>
